Where is the venue?
	<a href="https://www.kkcollection.com/the-villa-bentota">The Villa Bentota</a> is hosting us. We'll have the whole villa for two nights, so we have a ton of space to party and chill.
How do I get there?
	We've got you covered! Bentota is about 1.5 hours away from the airport near Colombo and there isn't a direct train from the airport to Bentota. Luckily, we're working with a taxi company to pick you up when you arrive at Bandaranaike International Airport (Colombo). Just update your RSVP with your flight arrival details when you have them. You may be sharing a car/van with other guests arriving at the same time.
Where should I stay?
	We will be staying at the venue so don't worry about a thing from Jan 31-Feb 2.
What do we have planned?
	Honestly we're just relaxing. Dinner is planned for Feb 1 (Saturday) night with drinks and music. We will also have a more relaxed dinner on Jan 31 (Friday) night when people are getting in. The rest of the day is for hanging out and chatting and having a good time. Feel free to take some time for yourself to explore the area and walk around the beach and do random water sports.<br>We also might set up some optional short excursions (not yet confirmed): a Turtle Hatchery (where you can learn about turtles and see baby turtles) on Friday evening, and a short river safari (where you'll be taken along the river and see some of the wildlife like water monitors) early Saturday morning.
Anything else I should plan around?
	Check in is on Jan 31 (Friday) in the afternoon and checkout is on Feb 2 (Sunday) at noon. However, feel free to stay in Sri Lanka longer. We recommend visiting Galle and Colombo if you have the time since they're just a short drive away.<br>We'll also have our Bangalore reception the following weekend which everyone is also invited to. RSVP for that too if you plan on attending, so we can plan accordingly and help you find a place to stay.
Is the event kid friendly?
	Of course.
Can I bring a plus-one?
	Your plus-one has been invited too.
What is the dresscode?
	It's going to be over 30&deg;C (90&deg;F) during the day so light, loose clothing and natural fabrics will be your friend.<br>Also come prepared to spend time on the beach or in the pool!
What should I bring?
	Come prepared for the sun: sunscreen, sunglasses, bathing suits. Mosquito repellent is useful for the evenings. <br>Our villa uses a type G plug (like in the UK), so a power adapter might be helpful.
Who should I contact if I have questions?
	For now, contacting us is totally fine. We'll update this answer around December, so check again if you have questions closer to the date.
When is the latest I can RSVP by?
	The earlier the better, but please let us know by the end of August to help with our planning.
R U Mine?
	Yes.
