# ADTRJ

Front-end website for RSVP tracking

Note: this website used to use withjoy.com as a back-end but it stopped working so we developed our own back-end at api.adtrj.com/rsvp

## Running locally

`./tools/server.sh`

## ~~Test graphql queries to withjoy.com~~

~~Update query.txt, variables.txt, and headers.txt as necessary. Then run `./query_graphql.sh`.~~
